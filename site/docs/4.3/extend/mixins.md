All mixins are generated by the `mixins_documentation` jekyll plugin under the `_plugins` folder. This plugins executes the `npm run mixins-documentation --silent` command. The `--silent` parameter prevents the filename to be output.

`npm run mixins-documentation --silent` runs `build/mixins-documentation.js`. This script reads all the `.scss` files in the `scss/mixins` folder and returns a list of the mixin names, the file location and the mixin itself in code block.

It's also possible to add a description to a mixin. Therefore you can add a comment block just above the mixin (no blank lines between the mixin and the comment block). Markdown is supported in these blocks. Stylelint comments are ignored.
